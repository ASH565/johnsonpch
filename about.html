		<h1>What Are Personal Care Homes?</h1>
		<p> Personal care homes provide seniors with board and care in the comfort of residential homes. Licensed by the state, personal care homes generally house between two to 10 seniors and provide varying levels of care. Also called adult care homes and residential care homes, these residences with private and semi-private rooms are often family-run by the owners living in the homes.</p>
